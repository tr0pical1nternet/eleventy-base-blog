Spruced is a personal organizing company, so when we designed their website it was important to keep the structure and aesthetic as clean as possible. We had a great starting point with origami-inspired logo designed by [Walker Ink](https://walkerinkworks.com/). We worked closely with Cary, the owner, to distill the idea of Spruced into an attractive presentation that flows effortlessly from the home page to the contact page. Responsive design was must, we took great care to design each element flexibly so they display beautifully on all devices and screen widths.
