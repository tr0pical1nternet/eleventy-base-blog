Raven needed a site that would showcase their innovativeness in the event design industry. They had a website on Squarespace but it was proving too rigid to fit their content as their company grew. They provided Photoshop comps for a desktop version. From those I designed mobile comps and then a fully responsive mobile-first theme. The site centers around their portfolio, so we carefully incorporated sliders, galleries, and carousels to convey their content as intuitively as possible. To imporove performance I used srcsets, lazy-loading and CloudFlare site caching.
