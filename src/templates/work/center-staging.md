Shortly after Raven purchased Center Staging they requested a new website to give the company a fresh image and make it easier to use for both customers and staff. In addition to the website, we updated the company's logo to make it feel contemporary while staying close enough to the existing branding that they could gradually phase it on their trucks, uniforms, signage, business cards, etc, avoiding costly upgrades.

The site features a custom icon menu
