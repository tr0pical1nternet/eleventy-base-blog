Fun with Arrays is an array visualizer I spun up on stage at #FrontEndParty, a monthly meetup in New Orleans. The talk I gave was an introduction to Svelte.js. If you’re not familiar, it’s a component framework similar to Vue or React, with the notable difference that it compiles at build time into vanilla JS. I wrote this as a project I could live-code in 7 minutes to demonstrate how easy it is to bind data to elements in Svelte. With minimal effort I was able to add transitions and FLIP animations to help illustrate the behavior of some popular array methods in JavaScript.
