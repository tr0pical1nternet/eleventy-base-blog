<!-- <h1 class="visually-hidden">Introduction</h1> -->
<p class="home-intro"><span class="home-intro-hi">Hi, I'm</span> <span class="home-intro-charles">Charles<br>Robertson.</span> <span class="home-intro-desc">I am a designer and developer who creates beautiful, resilient, and accessible websites.</span></p>

For clients I have built sites using Node.js and WordPress. You can see those in the [Work](work) section.

I often experiment with different facets of web design. You are welcome to take look at those on the [Projects](projects) page.

For seven years I have provided web and graphic design as Sediment Press, LLC, a design company I founded in Washington, DC. More on my skills and experience can be found on the [Resume](resume) page.

I am currently looking for a full time front end development position at a software company or creative agency in New Orleans. If you would like to talk I can be reached at <a href='&#109;ailt&#111;&#58;&#99;on&#116;&#97;c&#37;74&#64;%63&#37;68&#97;&#114;%6C%65&#37;&#55;3rob&#101;rt&#115;on%2Eio'>conta&#99;t&#64;c&#104;&#97;r&#108;esrob&#101;rt&#115;on&#46;io</a>.
