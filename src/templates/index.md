<p class="home-intro"><span class="home-intro-hi">Hi, I'm</span> <span class="home-intro-charles">Charles<br>Robertson.</span> <span class="home-intro-desc">I am a front end developer working to make the web a better place.</span></p>

I help creative teams build websites and apps that are easy to use, fast to load, and look good on any device. You can see sites that I have built for clients in the [Work](work) section.

I often experiment with different facets of web design. You are welcome to take look at those on the [Projects](projects) page.

For seven years I have provided web and graphic design as Sediment Press, LLC, a design company I founded in Washington, DC. More on my skills and experience can be found on the [Resume](resume) page.

I am currently looking for a full time front end development position at a software company or creative agency in New Orleans.
