<h1 class="visually-hidden">Introduction</h1>

<p class="home-intro"><span class="home-intro__hi">Hi, I'm</span> <span class="home-intro__charles">Charles Robertson.</span> <span class="home-intro__desc">I am a front end developer out to make the web a better place to be.</span></p>

I help creative teams build websites and apps that are easy to use, fast to load, and look good on any device. You can see sites that I have built for clients in the [Work](work) section.

I often experiment with different facets of web design. You are welcome to take look at those on the [Projects](projects) page.

I have recently closed the doors on my Washington, DC based design company, Sediment Press. More on my skills and experience can be found on the [Resume](resume) page.

I am currently looking for a full time front end development position at a software company or creative agency in New Orleans. If you would like to talk I can be reached at [contact@charlesrobertson.io](mailto:contact@charlesrobertson.io).
