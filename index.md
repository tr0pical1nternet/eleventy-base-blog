<h1 class="visually-hidden">Introduction</h1>

<p class="home-intro"><span class="home-intro__hi">Hi, I'm</span> <span class="home-intro__charles">Charles Robertson.</span> <span class="home-intro__desc">I am a front end developer out to make the web a better place to be.</span></p>

I help creative teams build websites and apps that are easy to use, load quickly, and look good on any device. You can see sites that I have built for clients in the [Work](work) section.

I often experiment with different facets of web design. You are welcome to take look at those on the [Projects](projects) page.

In 2012 I founded Sediment Press, a design and screen printing company in Washington, DC. For seven years we provided graphic design, web design, illustration, and screen printing services to individuals and organizations nationwide. Among our clients were Turnaround Arts, Outdoorsy, Live Nation, The American Society of Civil Engineers, World Food Program USA, and The Del Ray Business Association. We closed our doors in 2019 but I continue to do contract web development under my own name.

I am currently looking for a full time front end development position at a software company or creative agency in New Orleans. If you would like to talk I can be reached at [contact@charlesrobertson.io](mailto:contact@charlesrobertson.io).
